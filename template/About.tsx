                <Card.Title>Why Liquidity Matters</Card.Title>
                <Card.Text>
                  Liquidity is a crucial metric in cryptocurrency trading, representing the ease with which an asset can be bought or sold without causing significant price changes. Low liquidity can lead to higher volatility and increased risk, whereas high liquidity often indicates a stable market environment.

                  By accurately predicting liquidity changes, our platform aims to:

                <Card.Text>
                  Our system analyzes multiple market factors such as:
                </Card.Text>
                <ul>
                  <li>Historical price movements and trends</li>
                  <li>Volume and market capitalization dynamics</li>
                  <li>Rolling statistical features (moving averages, volatility)</li>
                  <li>Liquidity ratios including Amihud Illiquidity Ratio</li>
                  <li>Time-based features (daily, weekly, monthly patterns)</li>
                </ul>
                <Card.Text>
                  Using these engineered features, we train and deploy machine learning models that output reliable liquidity predictions.
